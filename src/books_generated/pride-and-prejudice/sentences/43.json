[
  "ELIZABETH, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\n    Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\n    in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.",
  "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.",
  "They\n    entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\n    a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.",
  "Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\n    every remarkable spot and point of view.",
  "They gradually ascended for\n    half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\n    eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\n    Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\n    the road with some abruptness wound.",
  "It was a large, handsome stone\n    building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\n    woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\n    swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.",
  "Its banks\n    were neither formal nor falsely adorned.",
  "Elizabeth was delighted.",
  "She\n    had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n    beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.",
  "They were\n    all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\n    to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!",
  "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\n    while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\n    meeting its owner returned.",
  "She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\n    mistaken.",
  "On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\n    hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\n    wonder at her being where she was.",
  "The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\n    fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.",
  "They\n    followed her into the dining-parlour.",
  "It was a large, well-proportioned\n    room, handsomely fitted up.",
  "Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\n    to a window to enjoy its prospect.",
  "The hill, crowned with wood, from\n    which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\n    distance, was a beautiful object.",
  "Every disposition of the ground was\n    good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\n    on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\n    it, with delight.",
  "As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\n    taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\n    to be seen.",
  "The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\n    suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\n    admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\n    fine,—with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\n    furniture of Rosings.",
  "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!",
  "With\n    these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted!",
  "Instead of\n    viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n    welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.",
  "But, no,” recollecting\n    herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\n    me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”",
  "This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something like regret.",
  "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\n    absent, but had not courage for it.",
  "At length, however, the question was\n    asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\n    replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\n    party of friends.”",
  "How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\n    not by any circumstance been delayed a day!",
  "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.",
  "She approached, and saw\n    the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\n    miniatures, over the mantel-piece.",
  "Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\n    she liked it.",
  "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\n    picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\n    had been brought up by him at his own expense.",
  "“He is now gone into the\n    army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”",
  "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\n    return it.",
  "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n    “is my master—and very like him.",
  "It was drawn at the same time as the\n    other—about eight years ago.”",
  "“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\n    looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face.",
  "But, Lizzy, you can tell\n    us whether it is like or not.”",
  "Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\n    intimation of her knowing her master.",
  "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”",
  "Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”",
  "“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”",
  "“Yes, very handsome.”",
  "“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\n    will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.",
  "This room was my late\n    master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\n    be then.",
  "He was very fond of them.”",
  "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.",
  "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\n    when she was only eight years old.",
  "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.",
  "“Oh, yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\n    accomplished!",
  "She plays and sings all day long.",
  "In the next room is a\n    new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master: she\n    comes here to-morrow with him.”",
  "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\n    communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\n    from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\n    master and his sister.",
  "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”",
  "“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\n    time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”",
  "“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”",
  "“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”",
  "“Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be.",
  "I do not know who is\n    good enough for him.”",
  "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.",
  "Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\n    very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”",
  "“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\n    him,” replied the other.",
  "Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\n    and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n    “I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\n    ever since he was four years old.”",
  "This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\n    ideas.",
  "That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\n    ",
  "Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\n    grateful to her uncle for saying,—",
  "“There are very few people of whom so much can be said.",
  "You are lucky in\n    having such a master.”",
  "“Yes, sir, I know I am.",
  "If I were to go through the world, I could not\n    meet with a better.",
  "But I have always observed, that they who are\n    good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\n    was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\n    world.”",
  "Elizabeth almost stared at her.",
  "“Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.",
  "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.",
  "“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just\n    as affable to the poor.”",
  "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.",
  "Mrs.\n    Reynolds could interest her on no other point.",
  "She related the subjects\n    of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\n    furniture in vain.",
  "Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n    prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\n    master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\n    many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",
  "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\n    lived.",
  "Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\n    themselves.",
  "There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\n    give him a good name.",
  "Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\n    saw anything of it.",
  "To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\n    away like other young men.”",
  "“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.",
  "“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\n    quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”",
  "“Perhaps we might be deceived.”",
  "“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”",
  "On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\n    sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\n    the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\n    give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\n    last at Pemberley.",
  "“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\n    one of the windows.",
  "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\n    the room.",
  "“And this is always the way with him,” she added.",
  "“Whatever\n    can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.",
  "There\n    is nothing he would not do for her.”",
  "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\n    all that remained to be shown.",
  "In the former were many good paintings:\n    but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n    visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n    Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n    also more intelligible.",
  "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n    little to fix the attention of a stranger.",
  "Elizabeth walked on in quest\n    of the only face whose features would be known to her.",
  "At last it\n    arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\n    such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\n    when he looked at her.",
  "She stood several minutes before the picture, in\n    earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\n    gallery.",
  "Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\n    father’s lifetime.",
  "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\n    sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\n    their acquaintance.",
  "The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n    was of no trifling nature.",
  "What praise is more valuable than the praise\n    of an intelligent servant?",
  "As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n    considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!",
  "How\n    much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!",
  "How much of good\n    or evil must be done by him!",
  "Every idea that had been brought forward by\n    the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\n    the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\n    herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\n    than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\n    its impropriety of expression.",
  "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n    they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\n    consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.",
  "As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n    to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\n    conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n    suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.",
  "They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\n    appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.",
  "Their eyes\n    instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\n    blush.",
  "He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\n    surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n    and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n    of perfect civility.",
  "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n    received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n    overcome.",
  "Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n    they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n    that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\n    beholding his master, must immediately have told it.",
  "They stood a little\n    aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n    scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\n    returned to his civil inquiries after her family.",
  "Amazed at the\n    alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\n    uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n    impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\n    minutes in which they continued together were some of the most\n    uncomfortable of her life.",
  "Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\n    spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\n    inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\n    in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n    distraction of his thoughts.",
  "At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\n    moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n    leave.",
  "The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\n    figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\n    feelings, followed them in silence.",
  "She was overpowered by shame and\n    vexation.",
  "Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\n    thing in the world!",
  "How strange must it appear to him!",
  "In what a\n    disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!",
  "It might seem as if\n    she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!",
  "Oh!",
  "why did she come?\n    ",
  "or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",
  "Had they been\n    only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\n    discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\n    moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.",
  "She blushed again and\n    again over the perverseness of the meeting.",
  "And his behaviour, so\n    strikingly altered,—what could it mean?",
  "That he should even speak to\n    her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\n    family!",
  "Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\n    never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n    ",
  "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\n    he put his letter into her hand!",
  "She knew not what to think, or how to\n    account for it.",
  "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n    every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n    reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\n    before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n    mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\n    to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n    distinguished no part of the scene.",
  "Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n    one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n    was.",
  "She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\n    what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n    she was still dear to him.",
  "Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n    felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was\n    not like ease.",
  "Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\n    her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n    composure.",
  "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n    roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",
  "They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n    ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\n    of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\n    the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\n    overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.",
  "Mr. Gardiner\n    expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\n    beyond a walk.",
  "With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\n    miles round.",
  "It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\n    circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\n    hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n    ",
  "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\n    the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\n    the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n    stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\n    it.",
  "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\n    the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n    who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\n    returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.",
  "Her niece was,\n    therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n    on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n    progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n    taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n    occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\n    about them, that he advanced but little.",
  "Whilst wandering on in this\n    slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\n    quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n    approaching them, and at no great distance.",
  "The walk being here less\n    sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\n    met.",
  "Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\n    interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n    calmness, if he really intended to meet them.",
  "For a few moments, indeed,\n    she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.",
  "The idea\n    lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n    turning past, he was immediately before them.",
  "With a glance she saw that\n    he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\n    she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\n    got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\n    recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\n    her might be mischievously construed.",
  "Her colour changed, and she said\n    no more.",
  "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n    her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n    ",
  "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\n    she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\n    acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\n    revolted, in his offer to herself.",
  "“What will be his surprise,” thought\n    she, “when he knows who they are!",
  "He takes them now for people of\n    fashion.”",
  "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n    relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n    it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n    could from such disgraceful companions.",
  "That he was surprised by the\n    connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\n    so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n    conversation with Mr. Gardiner.",
  "Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n    could not but triumph.",
  "It was consoling that he should know she had some\n    relations for whom there was no need to blush.",
  "She listened most\n    attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n    expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n    his taste, or his good manners.",
  "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\n    invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n    chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\n    time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n    the stream where there was usually most sport.",
  "Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n    walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\n    wonder.",
  "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\n    compliment must be all for herself.",
  "Her astonishment, however, was\n    extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered?",
  "From\n    what can it proceed?",
  "It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake\n    that his manners are thus softened.",
  "My reproofs at Hunsford could not\n    work such a change as this.",
  "It is impossible that he should still love\n    me.”",
  "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n    gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\n    brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n    water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.",
  "It originated in\n    Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n    Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n    her husband’s.",
  "Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n    together.",
  "After a short silence the lady first spoke.",
  "She wished him to\n    know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n    place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n    very unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n    you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\n    left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\n    the country.”",
  "He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\n    business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n    before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.",
  "“They\n    will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\n    who will claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr.",
  "Bingley and his sisters.”",
  "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.",
  "Her thoughts were instantly\n    driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\n    between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was\n    not very differently engaged.",
  "“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\n    pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you.",
  "Will you allow\n    me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\n    during your stay at Lambton?”",
  "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\n    for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.",
  "She immediately felt\n    that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\n    must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\n    satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\n    him think really ill of her.",
  "They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.",
  "Elizabeth\n    was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\n    pleased.",
  "His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\n    the highest kind.",
  "They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\n    reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\n    mile behind.",
  "He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not\n    tired, and they stood together on the lawn.",
  "At such a time much might\n    have been said, and silence was very awkward.",
  "She wanted to talk, but\n    there seemed an embargo on every subject.",
  "At last she recollected that\n    she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\n    great perseverance.",
  "Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience\n    and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.",
  "On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\n    the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\n    parted on each side with the utmost politeness.",
  "Mr. Darcy handed the\n    ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n    walking slowly towards the house.",
  "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\n    pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.",
  "“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.",
  "“There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\n    aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.",
  "I can now\n    say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n    I have seen nothing of it.”",
  "“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.",
  "It was more\n    than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\n    attention.",
  "His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”",
  "“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\n    or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\n    perfectly good.",
  "But how came you to tell us that he was so\n    disagreeable?”",
  "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\n    him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\n    seen him so pleasant as this morning.",
  "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\n    her uncle.",
  "“Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\n    at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\n    warn me off his grounds.”",
  "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\n    nothing.",
  "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\n    should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\n    anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.",
  "He has not an ill-natured look.\n    ",
  "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n    speaks.",
  "And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\n    not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.",
  "But, to be sure, the\n    good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\n    ",
  "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.",
  "But he is a liberal\n    master, I suppose, and that, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\n    every virtue.”",
