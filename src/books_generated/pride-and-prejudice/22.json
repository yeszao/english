  "THE Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\n    chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\n    ",
  "Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.",
  "“It keeps him in good\n    humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”",
  "Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\n    that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.",
  "This was\n    very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\n    had any conception of:—its object was nothing less than to secure her\n    from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\n    herself.",
  "Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\n    favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\n    sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\n    ",
  "But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\n    character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\n    morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n    himself at her feet.",
  "He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\n    from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\n    conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\n    till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\n    secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\n    he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.",
  "His\n    reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.",
  "Miss Lucas\n    perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\n    instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.",
  "But little had\n    she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.",
  "In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\n    everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\n    they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\n    was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\n    be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\n    his happiness.",
  "The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\n    guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\n    continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\n    disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\n    establishment were gained.",
  "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\n    and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.",
  "Mr. Collins’s present\n    circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\n    they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\n    exceedingly fair.",
  "Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n    interest than the matter had ever",
  "excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\n    Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\n    should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\n    expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\n    James’s.",
  "The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\n    occasion.",
  "The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two\n    sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\n    from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.",
  "Charlotte\n    herself was tolerably composed.",
  "She had gained her point, and had time\n    to consider of it.",
  "Her reflections were in general satisfactory.",
  "Mr.\n    Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\n    irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.",
  "But still he would\n    be her husband.",
  "Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\n    marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\n    provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\n    uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\n    from want.",
  "This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\n    twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\n    luck of it.",
  "The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\n    surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\n    valued beyond that of any other person.",
  "Elizabeth would wonder, and\n    probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\n    shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.",
  "She resolved\n    to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\n    when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\n    passed before any of the family.",
  "A promise of secrecy was of course very\n    dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\n    curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\n    questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\n    at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\n    publish his prosperous love.",
  "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\n    the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\n    moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\n    cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\n    whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.",
  "“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\n    gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\n    may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\n    possible.”",
  "They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\n    so speedy a return, immediately said,—",
  "“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\n    good sir?",
  "You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\n    offending your patroness.”",
  "“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\n    for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\n    material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”",
  "“You cannot be too much on your guard.",
  "Risk anything rather than her\n    displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\n    again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\n    and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.”",
  "“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\n    affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\n    from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\n    your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.",
  "As for my fair cousins,\n    though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\n    now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\n    my cousin Elizabeth.”",
  "With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\n    surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.",
  "Mrs. Bennet wished\n    to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\n    her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n    ",
  "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\n    solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\n    means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\n    improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\n    agreeable companion.",
  "But on the following morning every hope of this\n    kind was done away.",
  "Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\n    private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.",
  "The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\n    friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\n    that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\n    as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\n    consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\n    she could not help crying out,—",
  "“Engaged to Mr. Collins!",
  "my dear Charlotte, impossible!”",
  "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\n    story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\n    reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\n    her composure, and calmly replied,—",
  "“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?",
  "Do you think it incredible\n    that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\n    because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”",
  "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\n    for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\n    prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\n    wished her all imaginable happiness.",
  "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\n    very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\n    ",
  "But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\n    satisfied with what I have done.",
  "I am not romantic, you know.",
  "I never\n    was.",
  "I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\n    character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n    chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\n    entering the marriage state.”",
  "Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\n    they returned to the rest of the family.",
  "Charlotte did not stay much\n    longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.",
  "It\n    was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\n    unsuitable a match.",
  "The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\n    of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\n    accepted.",
  "She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\n    not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\n    that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\n    feeling to worldly advantage.",
  "Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\n    most humiliating picture!",
  "And to the pang of a friend disgracing\n    herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\n    that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\n    she had chosen."
